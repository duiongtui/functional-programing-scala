# functional-programing-scala

## Overview
- i create this repository to improve my functional programing skill. By reimplement all agorithms from
[100 days of algorithms challenge](https://github.com/coells/100days)
- i will implement all that agorithms as soon as possible. at least 2 days/ 1 agorithms
- Language: Scala. Scala is not pure functional programing language, but currently i work on a scala project. So i choose scala to improve my scala skill

## Progress

- Sat, 12/07/2019, create repository, review functional programing paradigm from [Programming Languages: Principles and Paradigms](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Languages-Principles-Paradigms-Undergraduate/dp/1848829132), i want to understand functional programing from man who developed a language point of view.
